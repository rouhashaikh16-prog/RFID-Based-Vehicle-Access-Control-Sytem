# RFID-Based-Vehicle-Access-Control-Sytem
The RFID Based Vehicle Access Control System uses RFID cards to allow or deny entry to vehicles. When a card is scanned, the system reads its unique ID and checks if it matches an authorized user. If valid, access is granted and shown on the LCD; if not, access is denied. This provides a quick, secure, and contactless method.
